# as - almost something

`as` (short for _almost-something_) is an attempt at creating an easy to use math library for prototype and hobby projects.

## Origins

The inspriation for this project came from reading an excellent blog post by Nathan Reed ([@Reedbeta](https://twitter.com/Reedbeta)) about writing a vector math library. You can find the post titled 'On Vector Math Libraries' [here](http://www.reedbeta.com/blog/on-vector-math-libraries/) (it's well worth a read!).

The post has some interesting advice on how one might write a math library and goes into some detail about the pros and cons of various approaches.

I decided to follow the advice outlined (template heavy, parameterized on dimensions and type). This gives a high degree of flexibility at a cost of some performance and compile times.

I've tried something a bit different with the interface (which is a little unusual) but I've grown quite fond of it over time. I'll try and persuade you the approach I've taken is ~~a good idea~~ not complete stupid ðŸ™ƒ.
